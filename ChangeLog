	Release 2.02~beta3

	grub_arch_sync_dma_caches: Accept volatile address

2016-02-27  Leif Lindholm  <leif.lindholm@linaro.org>

	efidisk: Respect block_io_protocol buffer alignment
	Returned from the OpenProtocol operation, the grub_efi_block_io_media
	structure contains the io_align field, specifying the minimum alignment
	required for buffers used in any data transfers with the device.

	Make grub_efidisk_readwrite() allocate a temporary buffer, aligned to
	this boundary, if the buffer passed to it does not already meet the
	requirements.

	Also sanity check the io_align field in grub_efidisk_open() for
	power-of-two-ness and bail if invalid.

	usbtrans: Fix memory coherence and use-after-free.

	ehci: Fix memory coherence
	This is a no-op on x86 but necessarry on ARM and may be necessarry on MIPS.

	arm-uboot: Make self-relocatable to allow loading at any address

	Allow _start == 0 with relocatable images

2016-02-27  Vladimir Serbinenko  <phcoder@gmail.com>

	Provide __bss_start and _end symbols in grub-mkimage.
	For this ensure that all bss sections are merged.

	We need this to correctly prelink non-PE relocatable images.

2016-02-27  Vladimir Serbinenko  <phcoder@gmail.com>

	Encapsulate image layout into a separate structure.
	Currently we pass around a lot of pointer. Instead put all relevant data
	into one structure.

	mkimagexx: Split PE and generic part for relocations.
	As a preparation for U-Boot relocations, split emitting PE-relocations
	from parsing source ELF-relocations.

	mkimage.c: Split into separate files.
	util/grub-mkimagexx.c is included in a special way into mkimage.c.
	Interoperation between defines makes this very tricky. Instead
	just have a clean interface and compile util/grub-mkimage*.c separately
	from mkimage.c

	bsd: Ensure that kernel is loaded before loading module.
	kernel_type may be set to the type of failed kernel. This patching-up is
	easier than to reflow kernel loading routines.

	cat: Don't switch terminal mode when there is nothing to highlight.
	This just pollutes serial console.

	Use console rather than serial_efi0 on arm64-efi in tests

	efidisk: fix misplaced parenthesis in b00e4c2

2016-02-26  Andrei Borzenkov  <arvidjaar@gmail.com>

	efidisk: prevent errors from diskfilter scan of removable drives
	Map EFI_NO_MEDIA to GRUB_ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE that is ignored by diskfilter. This
	actually matches pretty close (we obviously attempt to read outside of media)
	and avoids adding more error codes.

	This affects only internally initiated scans. If read/write from removable is
	explicitly requested, we still return an error and text explanation is more
	clear for user than generic error.

	Reported and tested by Andreas Loew <Andreas.Loew@gmx.net>

	net: fix ipv6 routing
	ipv6 routing in grub2 is broken, we cannot talk to anything outside our local
	network or anything that doesn't route in our global namespace.  This patch
	fixes this by doing a couple of things

	1) Read the router information off of the router advertisement.  If we have a
	router lifetime we need to take the source address and create a route from it.

	2) Changes the routing stuff slightly to allow you to specify a gateway _and_ an
	interface.  Since the router advertisements come in on the link local address we
	need to associate it with the global address on the card.  So when we are
	processing the router advertisement, either use the SLAAC interface we create
	and add the route to that interface, or loop through the global addresses we
	currently have on our interface and associate it with one of those addresses.
	We need to have a special case here for the default route so that it gets used,
	we do this by setting the masksize to 0 to mean it encompasses all networks.
	The routing code will automatically select the best route so if there is a
	closer match we will use that.

	With this patch I can now talk to ipv6 addresses outside of my local network.
	Thanks,

	ieee1275: prevent buffer over-read
	Prevent buffer over-read in grub_machine_mmap_iterate. This was
	causing phys_base from being calculated properly. This then
	caused the wrong value to be placed in ramdisk_image within
	struct linux_hdrs. Which prevented the ramdisk from loading on
	boot.

	Newer SPARC systems contain more than 8 available memory entries.

	For example on a T5-8 with 2TB of memory, the memory layout could
	look like this:

	menu_entry: Disable cursor during update_screen()
	When running grub in a VGA console of a KVM pseries guest on PowerPC,
	you can see the cursor sweeping over the whole line when entering a
	character in editor mode. This is visible because grub always refreshes
	the whole line when entering a character in editor mode, and drawing
	characters is quite a slow operation with the firmware used for the
	powerpc pseries guests (SLOF).
	To avoid this ugliness, the cursor should be disabled when refreshing
	the screen contents during update_screen().

	support modules without symbol table
	all_video module does not have any code or data and exists solely for
	.moddeps section to pull in dependencies. This makes all symbols unneeded.

	While in current binutils (last released version as of this commit is 2.26)
	``strip --strip-unneeded'' unintentionally adds section symbols for each
	existing section, this behavior was considered a bug and changed in commit
	14f2c699ddca1e2f706342dffc59a6c7e23e844c to completely strip symbol table
	in this case.

	Older binutils (verified with 2.17) and some other toolchains (at least
	elftoolchain r3223M), both used in FreeBSD, remove symbol table in all_video
	as well.

	Relax run-time check and do not return error for modules without symbol table.
	Add additional checks to module verifier to make sure such modules

	a) have non-empty .moddeps section. Without either externally visible symbols
	or .moddeps modules are completely useless and should not be built.

	b) do not have any relocations.

	Closes: 46986

	v2: add run-time check for empty symbol table if relocations are present as
	    suggested by Vladimir.

	10_linux: avoid multi-device root= kernel argument
	If root filesystem is multidev btrfs, do not attempt to pass all devices as
	kernel root= argument. This results in splitting command line in GRUB due to
	embedded newline and even if we managed to quote it, kernel does not know how
	to interpret it anyway. Multidev btrfs requires user space device scanning,

	clang as incomplete mcmodel=large support. As we don't currently need full
	mcmodel=large support for sparc64, relax those checks.

	Disable build-time module check on emu.
	On emu some checks can be laxer like check for relocation range. Additionally
	module loading in emu is rarely used. So skip this check rather than making
	it laxer for all platforms. In ideal we may want to have slightly different
	check for emu but for now this is good enough.

	configure: Fix grub_cv_cc_fno_unwind_tables check.
	Check tries -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm but adds -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
	to TARGET_CFLAGS. Fix this.

	Add -mno-stack-arg-probe on mingw.
	This argument disables generation of calls to __chkstk_ms. Those calls are
	useless on GRUB as function is dummy. Yet they increase module size and
	use limited-range relocations which may not work under some memory layouts.
	We currently don't use such layouts on concerned platforms but lt's correct
	this.

	Strip .ARM.exidx
	This section is generated by clang and is useful only for debugging.
	It contains exotic relocations, so strip them to avoid them interferring

	This was lost when code was refactored. Patch restores previous behavior.

	It is still not clear whether this is the right one. Due to the way we
	detect DM abstraction, partitions on DM are skipped, we fall through to
	generic detection which ends up in assuming parent device is BIOS disk.

	It is useful to install GRUB on VM disk from the host. But it also means
	that GRUB will mistakenly allow install on real system as well.

	windows: correct LBA in generated EFI HDD media paths
	GRUB keeps partition offset and size in units of 512B sectors. Media paths
	are defined in terms of LBA which are presumed to match HDD sector size.

	This is probably cosmetic (EFI requires that partition is searched by GUID)
	and still incorrect if GPT was created using different logical block size.
	But current code is obviously wrong and new has better chances to be correct.

	lsefimmap: support persistent memory and other UEFI 2.5 features
	This should accompany
		76ce1de740 Translate UEFI persistent memory type

	1. Add a string for the EfiPersistentMemory type 14 that was
	added in UEFI 2.5.

	2. Decode the memory attributes that were added in UEFI 2.5:
	* NV (non-volatile)
	* MORE_RELIABLE (higher reliable, e.g., mirrored memory in a system
	  with partial memory mirroring)
	* RO (read-only)

	3. Use proper IEC binary units (KiB, MiB, etc.) for power-of-two
	values rather than misusing SI power-of-ten units (KB, MB, etc.)

	4. The lsmmap command only decodes memory ranges sizes up to GiB scale
	units.  Persistent memory ranges will reach into the TiB scale.
	Since 64-bit size field supports TiB, PiB, and EiB, decode all of
	them for completeness.

	5. In the lsefimmap command, rewrite the print statements to
	* avoid rounding
	* avoid a big nested if/else tree.

	For example: In the sixth entry below, the value of 309MB implies
	316416KB but is really reporting 316436KB.

	Widen the size column to 6 digits to accommodate typical cases.
	The worst case value would require 14 digits; if that happens,
	let the columns get out of sync.

	Old format:

	tcp: ack when we get an OOO/lost packet
	While adding tcp window scaling support I was finding that I'd get some packet
	loss or reordering when transferring from large distances and grub would just
	timeout.  This is because we weren't ack'ing when we got our OOO packet, so the
	sender didn't know it needed to retransmit anything, so eventually it would fill
	the window and stop transmitting, and we'd time out.  Fix this by ACK'ing when
	we don't find our next sequence numbered packet.  With this fix I no longer time
	out.  Thanks,

	configure: find options to force endian on MIPS

2015-10-14  Andrei Borzenkov  <arvidjaar@gmail.com>

	configure: force o32 ABI on MIPS
	GRUB code expects O32 or N32. N32 is less tested than O32, so we prefer to
	compile with O32. Some systems (e.g. GNU Guix) default to using newer
	n64 or n32 ABI. Try to find suitable options to force o32.

	For GCC this is simply -mabi=32. While clang supports this option as well,
	o32 ABI is valid for MIPS target and n32/64 ABI are valid for MIPS64 target
	only, so use "-target mips/mipsel -mabi=32".

	progress: avoid NULL dereference for net files
	From original patch by dann frazier <dann.frazier@canonical.com>:

	  grub_net_fs_open() saves off a copy of the file structure it gets passed and
	  uses it to create a bufio structure. It then overwrites the passed in file
	  structure with this new bufio structure. Since file->name doesn't get set
	  until we return back to grub_file_open(), it means that only the bufio
	  structure gets a valid file->name. The "real" file's name is left
	  uninitialized. This leads to a crash when the progress module hook is called
	  on it.

	grub_net_fs_open() already saved copy of file name as ->net->name, so change
	progress module to use it.

	Also, grub_file_open may leave file->name as NULL if grub_strdup fails. Check
	for it.

	file: ignore host disk in blocklist check
	It cannot work anyway because host disk cannot be read. This fixes hostfs access
	on native Windows build where filenames start with '\' or do not have initial
	separator at all (d:\foo).

	Issue was observed when running grub-fstest on Windows. On UNIX image name is
	canonicalized to always start with `/' so this was not noticed.

	This has side effect of allowing relative path names on host, but this already
	was the case with `ls' command, so it just extends it to all commands.

	efinet: handle get_status() on buggy firmware properly
	The EFI spec indicates that get_status() should return the address of the buffer
	we passed into transmit to indicate the the buffer was transmitted.  However we
	have boxes where the firmware returns some arbitrary address instead, which
	makes grub think that we've not sent anything.  So since we have the SNP stuff
	opened in exclusive mode just assume any non-NULL txbuf means that our transmit
	occurred properly.  This makes grub able to do its networking stuff properly on

	bootp: ignore gateway_ip (relay) field.
	From RFC1542:

	   The 'giaddr' field is rather poorly named.  It exists to facilitate
	   the transfer of BOOTREQUEST messages from a client, through BOOTP
	   relay agents, to servers on different networks than the client.
	   Similarly, it facilitates the delivery of BOOTREPLY messages from the
	   servers, through BOOTP relay agents, back to the client.  In no case
	   does it represent a general IP router to be used by the client.  A
	   BOOTP client MUST set the 'giaddr' field to zero (0.0.0.0) in all
	   BOOTREQUEST messages it generates.

	   A BOOTP client MUST NOT interpret the 'giaddr' field of a BOOTREPLY
	   message to be the IP address of an IP router.  A BOOTP client SHOULD
	   completely ignore the contents of the 'giaddr' field in BOOTREPLY
	   messages.

	Leave code ifdef'd out for the time being in case we see regression.

	efinet: open Simple Network Protocol exclusively
	EDK2 network stack is based on Managed Network Protocol which is layered

	Open SNP device exclusively.  This destroys all child MNP instances and
	stops background polling.

	Exclusive open cannot be done when enumerating cards, as it would destroy
	PXE information we need to autoconfigure interface; and it cannot be done
	during autoconfiguration as we need to do it for non-PXE boot as well. So
	move SNP open to card ->open method and add matching ->close to clean up.

	EDK2 PXE driver creates two child devices - IPv4 and IPv6 - with
	bound SNP instance. This means we get three cards for every physical
	adapter when enumerating. Not only is this confusing, this may result
	in grub ignoring packets that come in via the "wrong" card.

	Example of device hierarchy is

	 Ctrl[91] PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x3,0x0)
	   Ctrl[95] PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x3,0x0)/MAC(525400123456,0x1)
	     Ctrl[B4] PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x3,0x0)/MAC(525400123456,0x1)/IPv4(0.0.0.0)
	     Ctrl[BC] PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x3,0x0)/MAC(525400123456,0x1)/IPv6(0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000)

	Skip PXE created virtual devices when enumerating cards. Make sure to
	find real card when applying initial autoconfiguration during PXE boot,
	this information is associated with one of child devices.

	loader/linux: do not pad initrd with zeroes at the end
	Syslinux memdisk is using initrd image and needs to know uncompressed
	size in advance. For gzip uncompressed size is at the end of compressed
	stream. Grub padded each input file to 4 bytes at the end, which means
	syslinux got wrong size.

	Linux initramfs loader apparently does not care about trailing alignment.
	So change code to align beginning of each file instead which atomatically
	gives us the correct size for single file.

	zfs: add missing NULL check and fix incorrect buffer overwrite

	Recognize EFI platform even in case of mismatch between Linux and EFI.
	Some x86 systems might be capable of running a 64-bit Linux kernel but
	only use a 32-bit EFI (e.g. Intel Bay Trail systems). It's useful for
	grub-install to be able to recognise such systems, to set the default
	x86 platform correctly.

	To allow grub-install to know the size of the firmware rather than
	just the size of the kernel, there is now an extra EFI sysfs file to
	describe the underlying firmware. Read that if possible, otherwise
	fall back to the kernel type as before.

	Remove libgcc dependency.
	libgcc for boot environment isn't always present and compatible.

	Makefile.am: Fix Changelog cutoff address.
	gitlog-to-changelog Doesn't generate entries for cutoff day, only
	for days after the cutoff date, adjust by one to compensate.

	efidisk: Return the determined root disk even if partition is unknown.

	util/grub-mkrescue.c: Always include part_msdos and part_gpt on EFI.
	When booted from stick, EFI would use GPT partition and our root
	device detection algortihm depends on GRUB's ability to see the same
	partitions. Hence include msdos and gpt partmap modules on EFI even when
	they're not needed to access root filesystem.

	conf/Makefile.common: Remove unused {LD,C}FLAGS_CPU.

	Autogenerate ChangeLog from git changelog.
	Old ChangeLog is moved to ChangeLog-2015. For all changes starting from
	this one ChangeLog will be generated from gitlog only on explicit make
	invocation and make dist.

	accept also hdX as alias to native Xen disk name
	To be compatible with legacy pv-grub, sort disks by increasing order of handle
	value. This allows reusing legacy pv-grub menu.lst which is using hdX names.
